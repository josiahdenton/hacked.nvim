## Next Steps

- [ ] tree sitter node quick move / swap
- [ ] portal -- used in other modules, can grow as user adds newlines
- [ ] process dump, go through and delete what you want
- [ ] docker dump, start/restart/delete
- [ ] multi-buffer
    - new tab
    - each line has virtual text with error + vt of code block + surrounding
    - uses a borderless portal to edit code block on `<enter>`
    - newlines extend the portal + vt 
    - `<esc><esc>` from insert goes -->normal-->close portal, leaving text behind as vt
    - tab moves next
    - once error is resolved we either leave the diagnostic but gray out OR we re-draw / refresh all diagnostics
